                    In this blogpost I want to show you how you can easily get your React SPA app
                    with clientside router work properly with your Nginx setup. I will also show you
                    how to serve your React App over HTTP/2 and how you can leverage from http2
                    server pushes. To do so I will show you how to do that with the Nginx Docker
                    image.

                    When running your webapp using the development server you will in general not
                    face any issues, however when running the static build on a production server
                    you will most likely face some issues. E.g. If you use React Router with a route
                    for /todo/42 your webserver will be looking for a file called /build/todo/42
                    which can't be found. Therefore we will need to direct our webserver to the
                    index.html.

                    When using Nginx Docker image with the default configuration you will figure
                    that you will get 404 responses as soon you reach a page navigated by the
                    clientside React router. We will explore further on how to resolve that and how
                    to add some performance tuning as well.
